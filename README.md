# F1 Race Animated Visualizer 🏎️

The idea for this project comes from my obssesion with Formula 1. With the abundance of F1 race data out there, i haven't seen a neat and interactive way to visualize it.

Thus, I put together program that allow you to visualize any race record by [FastF1]([url](https://docs.fastf1.dev/)). 

# Usage 💻
1. Run the program
2. Choose year
3. Choose race location
4. Choose type of session
5. Choose driver
6. Then, race animation will be displayed

This project has unlimited growth potential as there are many ways to visualize race data. Thus, I'm always open to collboration. 

# Contribute 💪
